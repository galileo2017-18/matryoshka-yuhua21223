# Matryoshka


Matryoshka lab part 1<br>
<ul>
<li>Add three instance fields to the Matryoshka class; a String called name, a java.awt.Color called hair, and a boolean called babushka. Expand the constructors to assign these fields at instantiation.
<li>Write a new recursive method, howManyWearingBabushkas. If the babushka field is true, that Matryoshka is wearing a babushka.
<li>Write a new recursive method, redHeadCount. If the hair is equal to java.awt.Color.RED, that Matryoshka has red hair, sometimes known as being a redhead.
<li>Write a new recursive method, lastName. If a Matryoshka has no inner doll, then its name is alphabetically last of the collection. If a Matryoshka has an inner doll, and its name is later in the alphabet than the last of the inner doll's collection, then its name is the last name. Otherwise, the last name of the inner doll's collection is the last name. Use the String compareTo method to see which name is later in the alphabet.
</ul>
